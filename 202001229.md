Q1 : LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM (LIS)

------ Functional Requirements -------

1: A system ought to display all the essential information about the book.
2: When a user wants to issue the book, the system should prompt them for their username and password. The system determines whether the entered information is correct, such as whether the password is entered correctly or whether the entered username is valid.
3: According to user's needs, a system should enable users to search for books in the library using criteria like the title, author, publication date, etc.
4: The system should manage periodicals, It means items that come on a periodical basis, such as newspapers, journals etc. Its function is to handle the periodicals in a proper manner.
5: Each item receives a different unique identification number from the system. Additionally, it ought to give each member a unique identifying number.
6: By entering their membership number, users should be able to reserve a specific item they want from anywhere using the system.
7: The LIS system should allow the user to borrow a book or return it if already borrowed only if the user is a member of the system. A user will request for borrowing a book and when a librarian acknowledges it, the book is finally borrowed by him/her.
8: The system should not provide the user the opportunity to borrow a book if it has already been checked out by another user and should instead inform the user that the book has already been checked out by others.
9: Only if the user is a member of the system should the LIS system allow the user to borrow a book or return it if it has already been borrowed. Once a librarian acknowledges a user's request to borrow a book, the user is then able to do so.
10: If a user requests a list of the books they have presently borrowed, books they have previously borrowed, the date they were borrowed and returned, and other information, the system should do so for that user.
11: When a new book is purchased, a system should enable the librarian to add a new record to the database or remove a record in the event that a book is taken off the shelf.
12: The system ought to calculate the fine for the overdue books when they are returned and notify the user and librarian of the overdue books.
13: The system should allow the better search option for available stock of books.



------ Non-Functional Requirements ------

1: Availability - The System should be available for the duration when the library operates and must be recovered within an hour or less if it fails. The system should 2: respond to the requests within two seconds or less.
3: Security - The system would ask an user a username and password for entering into the system. It should also make sure that it works on the institute LAN.
4: Reliability - System should be available in the duration when the library operates. There should not occur any failure in the system during this particular time.
5: Maintainability -The system should be designed to make updating data as simple as feasible. Even if changes are made, the current system should continue to function 6: properly. The system should function properly in the event that additional features are necessary to be added.
7: Portability -  Access to the database is possible on any platform other than the one it was originally designed for.
8: Performance - The system should respond to requests within two to three seconds.
9: Flexibility - The system should ensure that the user may easily access pertinent information. Everyone should be able to understand the user interface. If the choice of many languages is offered, it may be even simpler.
10: Scalability - When a larger number of people access the system, the system shouldn't fail and should function consistently.
11: Accuracy - The system must guarantee that the information stored regarding the books and the penalty calculations is accurate and consistent.

Q2 : Application for deaf people

------ Scope ------
People in our culture who are disabled and unable to communicate exist. They need someone to lead them since they cannot survive on their own. 
We set out to develop a significant answer for anyone who could profit from easier access to regular sound events. They can communicate with the outside world with the aid of this programme. With the aid of the sound stored in the application, it will assist them in informing others.

------ Functional Requirements ------

1: When a user wants immediate alerts, the system should inquire what tone they would like, such as a bell tone or car horns.
2: System should also allow you to choose the output type i.e. it wants the output in the form of tone, vibration, or both tone and vibration.
3: System should allow editing , delete voice information, voice types, etc.
4: The user should be able to select the time interval in which they want to tell others using the system.
5: The system must let you select more than one voice requirement as the speech recognition outcome tone.
6: Users can opt to send the warning through phone, email, or both depending on where they want it to go.
7: The system should indicate the type of sound events, such as door knocking, door bell, car horn, etc.
8: The user can activate the flashlight using the system whenever necessary.

------ Non - Functional Requirements ------

1: Any user, regardless of age, should find the system easy to use, and it should provide appropriate guidance.
2: The system should respond quickly, without any errors, and its performance shouldn't degrade with time or use.
3: Any voice on the list should be recognised by the system without issue.
4: The system should be simple to use and understand. To ensure that all new users utilize the system correctly, it can offer a help page.
5: In the event of a mistake or system failure, the administrator and user should be notified.
6: Any query should respond quickly to guarantee that the needs are met.
7: The system should permit the addition of new voices without altering existing ones.
8: All smartphones with Android software should be able to operate the system.
9: The system should contain expressive images.
